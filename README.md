# 👁️‍🗨️ Vision Annotation 🔤

🚀 This project utilizes **OpenCV** to detect eyes and annotate them in real-time while also detecting a chessboard and numbering its corners sequentially.

---

## 🎯 Overview
This system performs two key tasks:
1. **Eye Detection & Annotation**: Uses Haar Cascade Classifier to detect eyes and overlay text annotations.
2. **Chessboard Corner Numbering**: Detects a chessboard pattern and sequentially numbers the detected corners.

This project is useful for both **facial recognition applications** and **computer vision calibration**.

---

## 🏠 Project Workflow 📌
1. **Eye Detection & Annotation** 👁️
   - Uses a pre-trained Haar Cascade model to detect eyes.
   - Draws bounding boxes and labels detected eyes with predefined text.
2. **Chessboard Corner Numbering** ♟️
   - Identifies a chessboard pattern in a video stream.
   - Assigns and displays sequential numbers to each detected corner.
